# General Data Protection Act (GDPR)

General Data Protection Act (GDPR) entered into force on May 25, 2018. It replaced the current law on the protection of personal data. The GDPR applied in all 28 countries of the European Union, thus unifying their diverse data protection regulations. On last May the period of two-year implementation of new regulations ended, during which companies had the opportunity to prepare for the upcoming changes. The new regulation aims to increase the level of personal data protection and adapt the scope of personal data protection to contemporary realities.

Formsure offers a data processing agreement (DPA) for customers processing information on behalf of EU and Swiss citizens. Please contact privacy@formsure.co for more information.

As we all work to understand and apply GDPR concepts to our own businesses, we’ve created the below outline to keep you informed of our efforts. We’ll be proactively reaching out to our entire customer base once we have best practices to share.
